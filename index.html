    <h2>Butterfield Canyon</h2>

    <p>Try this 13.2-mile point-to-point trail near Herriman, Utah. Generally considered an easy route, 
        it takes an average of 6 h 51 min to complete. 
        This is a popular trail for off-road driving and scenic driving, 
        but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. For more information :

    <h2>Alpine Loop</h2>

    <p>The Eastern United States has Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachians, 
        but the West has the Rocky Mountains! Take Highway 92 on a 20 mile drive through winding 
        canyons and mountains for one of the best scenic drives in Utah County. 
        The fall colors are absolutely breathtaking. Along the alpine scenic backway, 
        visit Cascade Springs, take a stroll around Robert Redford's Sundance Mountain Resort, 
        or go hiking! We suggest hiking to the Timpanogos Cave National Monument before it closes 
        for the season in October. The Alpine Loop generally closes mid-October so be sure to get 
        there before then, during peak color time. For more information :
